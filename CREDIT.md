The credit for the flight control code goes almost entirely to the MultiWii crew. I made some alterations to get an NRF24L01
radio chip working with it, but other than that, they credit must go to them. 

I am also working on integrating the CleanFlight serial protocol, so that I can use the CleanFlight (or BetaFlight) gui instead
of the MultiWii GUI. I develop on a Mac, and the MultiWii GUI has stopped working entirely, so after messing around with VM's, dual booting
Linux, and switching laptops, I have now come to CleanFlight. If I can get it working, the credit for the alterations to the Serial Protocol 
goes to Jayson Ragasa (Nullstr1ng).
