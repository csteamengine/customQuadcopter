# Heimdall Mark I
The goal of this project is to create my own quadcopter using a modified version of the open source MultiWii flight control software in junction with the EZ-Wifibroadcast FPV system. As this project is still under development, I haven't taken the time to do a full write up of the parts and processes involved, but I will try to keep it as updated as possible during development.

# Features
* Long Range radio communication (NRF24L01)
* Wireless FPV via EZ-wifibroadcast RPi image
* Remote control with Integrated touchscreen
* Custom Button Functionality
* Customized Arduino MultiWii flight controller
* Tiltable camera mounted on drone
* Video recording
* Image Capture

# Future Goals
* Altitude and position hold
* GPS flight planning
* Retractable landing gear
* TRICKS!?!?!?
* Mark II - Start over and make it better!

# Team
This project is being developed solely by me, at this point, but if you feel like contributing to this project, just feel free to let me know.
